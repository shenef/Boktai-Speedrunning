# Boktai 1: 28 Dungeons Route

{{#title Boktai 1: 28 Dungeons Route}}

## About this Guide

While the current WR follows this route, it is far from optimized. So far only the Empty Gourds are properly routed; Speed Nuts, Bananas and Grenades have a lot more potential and the WR still picks up a good amount of items that are not necessary.

Please suggest improvements!

Some of the images are kinda rough, initially these were just my (shenef) personal notes and are now slowly being expanded. For now, if a dungeon just has "...", there is either nothing noteworthy to do or it's still directly from my notes.

The icons on the map indicate how you are expected to leave that dungeon.  
Some dungeons simply take longer to leave on foot.

Finish this Dungeon three times. This gains you a total of +18 Speed Nuts and +3 Bombs.

It's likely that, even in 28 Dungeons, good item routing could reduce it from three completions to two or even one.
