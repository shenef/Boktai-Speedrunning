# How to write Guides

These guides are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).  
There are a couple good tutorials available such as [markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

If you want to contribute directly, you can visit the repository on GitHub and submit changes by editing the files there and then submitting a Pull request.

Because of how mdBook works and the adjustments we made, many markdown previews won't display correctly. But if you are following good practices and the examples here, it should display just fine on the final site.

If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0dUb9OmJrIrRPFGf).

Below are a couple of examples on how to use the adjustments we made to mdBook for writing Boktai guides specifically.

## Examples

### <span class="sol">Elemental</span> <span class="cloud">colors</span>

Used to mark the use of elements. For example on recommended Lenses or Enchantments.  
Legible on the Dark themes but on the Light themes they are not exactly great.

- <span class="sol">Sol</span>  
  `<span class="sol">Sol</span>`
- <span class="luna">Luna</span>  
  `<span class="luna">Luna</span>`
- <span class="dark">Dark</span>  
  `<span class="dark">Dark</span>`
- <span class="flame">Flame</span>  
  `<span class="flame">Flame</span>`
- <span class="frost">Frost</span>  
  `<span class="frost">Frost</span>`
- <span class="earth">Earth</span>  
  `<span class="earth">Earth</span>`
- <span class="cloud">Cloud</span>  
  `<span class="cloud">Cloud</span>`

### <span class="boss">Markers</span>

Used to mark headers and strategies. Font color changes on hover.

- <span class="safety">Safety / Backup strat</span>  
  `<span class="safety">Safety / Backup strat</span>`
- <span class="trap">Trap</span>  
  `<span class="trap">Trap</span>`
- <span class="mission">Mission</span>  
  `<span class="mission">Mission</span>`
- <span class="boss">Boss fight</span>  
  `<span class="boss">Boss fight</span>`
- <span class="purification">Purification</span>  
  `<span class="purification">Purification</span>`
- <span class="puzzle">Puzzle</span>  
  `<span class="puzzle">Puzzle</span>`

### Embedded video files

<video controls muted>
  <source src="./boktai/assets/video/bloodrust_puzzle.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

Encoded using:

```powershell
ffmpeg -i "input.mkv" -vf "scale=2*iw:2*ih:flags=neighbor" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 38 -row-mt 1 -deadline best -pix_fmt yuv420p -pass 1 -an -f null NUL &&
ffmpeg -i "input.mkv" -vf "scale=2*iw:2*ih:flags=neighbor" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 38 -row-mt 1 -deadline best -pix_fmt yuv420p -pass 2 -c:a libopus -b:a 96k "output.webm"
```

Slow to encode and higher quality than needed but videos in guides are never going to be long anyway.

Embedded using:

```html
<video controls muted>
  <source src="./boktai/assets/video/test.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### YouTube, Twitch embeds

Make sure the URL is formatted like this:

- <https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHMaErqqU_E>
- <https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2328442079&parent=shenef.github.io&autoplay=false>

Set `aspect-ratio` to the aspect ratio of your video. Usually `16/9` but direct GBA exports are `3/2`.  
Title is not mandatory but it helps to identify the video when you don't have a markdown preview.

Sadly the embed system of Twitch is terrible and the video will only load if the "parent" parameter in the URL is set <span class="boss">and</span> matches the page it's embedded into. For local testing you'll have to set that "parent" parameter to `localhost`.

YouTube:

```html
<iframe
  style="aspect-ratio: 2/1"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHMaErqqU_E"
  title="Boktai 1 28 Dungeons in 2:16:15"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

<iframe
  style="aspect-ratio: 2/1"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHMaErqqU_E"
  title="Boktai 1 28 Dungeons in 2:16:15"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

Twitch:

```html
<iframe
  style="aspect-ratio: 16/9"
  src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2328442079&parent=shenef.github.io&autoplay=false"
  title="Boktai 1: Any% Normal 2 speedrun in 1:30:06"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

<iframe
  style="aspect-ratio: 16/9"
  src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2328442079&parent=shenef.github.io&autoplay=false"
  title="Boktai 1: Any% Normal 2 speedrun in 1:30:06"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

### Interactive elements

You can use javascript within a book, which allows for some interactivity.  
Below is a simple example but theoretically that allows for

- conditional Guides that show/hide strats based on user input
- inlined tools like calculators, RNG manip helpers, ...
- etc.

Example:  
Write something here: <input type="text" id="input_in_mdbook">  
Then press this
<button
  type="button"
  onclick="alert(document.getElementById('input_in_mdbook').value)" >
  suspicious button
</button>
to show it as a popup.

### Definition lists

Definition lists can be used for things like glossary entries. The term is listed on a line by itself, followed by one or more definitions. Each definition must begin with a `:` (after 0-2 spaces).

Example:

```md
term A
  : This is a definition of term A. Text
    can span multiple lines.

term B
  : This is a definition of term B.
  : This has more than one definition.
```

This will render as:

term A
  : This is a definition of term A. Text
    can span multiple lines.

term B
  : This is a definition of term B.
  : This has more than one definition.

Terms are clickable just like headers, which will set the browser's URL to point directly to that term.

### Admonitions

An admonition is a special type of callout or notice block used to highlight important information. It is written as a blockquote with a special tag on the first line.

```md
> [!NOTE]
> General information or additional context.

> [!TIP]
> A helpful suggestion or best practice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information that shouldn't be missed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical information that highlights a potential risk.

> [!CAUTION]
> Information about potential issues that require caution.
```

These look like this:

> [!WARNING]
> Critical information that highlights a potential risk.

This feature is enabled by default.
To disable it, see the [`output.html.admonitions`] config option.

### Checklists

Helper to track progression on long or complicated routes.  
Displayed as a floating box on the bottom right.

```html
<div class="checklist">
  <b>Checklist example</b><br>
  <label><input type="checkbox" checked/> Got WR</label><br>
  <label><input type="number" min=0 max=1200 value=234> Debt</label>
</div>
```

<div class="checklist">
  <b>Checklist example</b><br>
  <label><input type="checkbox" checked/> Got WR</label><br>
  <label><input type="number" min=0 max=1200 value=234> Debt</label>
</div>
