# Boktai 3: Any% Route

{{#title Boktai 3: Alternate Any% Route (Clock Tower + Solar Bank interests)}}

```admonish danger title="Work in Progress"
This guide focuses on a potential new route involving a new money route that uses the Clock Tower and Solar Bank interests to get Solls.

Many cards are skipped, as they were either used for money or are considered to be not worth getting (time cost too high compared to benefits from using the card).
```
