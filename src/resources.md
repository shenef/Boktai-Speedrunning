## Emulation

For legal reasons we cannot provide you with a GBA BIOS or Boktai ROMs.

### BizHawk

- <http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html>
- <https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk>

To establish parity between console and emulator, these settings are required for speedruns:

- `GBA` > `Settings` > `Sync Settings`, set "Skip BIOS" to "False".
- `Config` > `Customize` > `General`, uncheck "Pause when menu activated".
- To simulate a dead battery: `GB` > `Settings` > `Sync Settings`, set "RTC" to False  
  (Requires BizHawk v2.6.3+)
