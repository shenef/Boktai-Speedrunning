## Emulation

### BizHawk

- <http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html>
- <https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk>

Settings required for speedruns:

- `GBA` > `Settings` > `Sync Settings`, set "Skip BIOS" to "False".
- To simulate a dead battery: `GB` > `Settings` > `Sync Settings`, set "RTC" to False (BizHawk v2.6.3+)

These settings establish parity between console and emulator.  
For legal reasons we cannot provide you with a GBA BIOS or Boktai ROMs.
