If you just want to quickly and easily run mdbook, [download the latest release here](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/latest).  
Put the executable in the same folder as this readme and run `./mdbook.exe serve --open` in the terminal to get a live preview in your browser.

<br>
If the mdbook.exe is not enough for your usage, you can install the full setup like this:

- install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- run `cargo install mdbook mdbook-linkcheck`.

Now you can run `mdbook serve --open` to get the live preview.
